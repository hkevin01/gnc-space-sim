5. `apps/web/tests/README.md` - Documentation
6. `test-runner.sh` - Utility script
7. `verify-testing-setup.sh` - Setup verification

### 📋 Test Files Created

**Playwright Tests:**

- `tests/playwright/smoke.spec.ts`
- `tests/playwright/orbital-mechanics.spec.ts`
- `tests/playwright/fixtures.ts`

**Cypress Tests:**

- `tests/cypress/e2e/smoke.cy.ts`

### 🎯 Performance Budgets

Lighthouse CI enforces:

- **Performance:** 80% minimum score
- **Accessibility:** 90% minimum score
- **Best Practices:** 85% minimum score
- **SEO:** 90% minimum score

### 🔄 CI/CD Integration

The GitHub Actions workflow now includes:

1. TypeScript type checking
2. ESLint code quality
3. Unit tests with Vitest
4. Application build
5. Playwright E2E tests
6. Cypress E2E tests
7. Lighthouse performance audits
8. Artifact collection for reports

### ✅ Current Status

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   npx playwright install
   ```

2. **Run Initial Tests:**

   ```bash
   ./test-runner.sh setup
